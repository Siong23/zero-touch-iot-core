# Zero-Touch IoT Core 

> **A cloud-native platform for automated orchestration, management, and secure operation of IoT applications at the edge.**

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project demonstrates an integrated orchestration approach for both **network services** and **cloud-native IoT applications**.  
It combines **network slice management** via [OpenSlice](https://openslice.io/) with **Kubernetes-based IoT service deployment** and **device lifecycle management** through an IoT platform.  
The result is an end-to-end system capable of delivering optimized connectivity and compute for IoT workloads.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Hybrid Orchestration** â€“ Manage both network slices (CNFs/VNFs) and IoT microservices from a unified workflow.
- **Cloud-Native Deployment** â€“ Deploy IoT services (MQTT brokers, analytics, APIs) on Kubernetes.
- **Device Lifecycle Management** â€“ Register, monitor, and control IoT devices through an integrated IoT platform.
- **Closed-Loop Automation** â€“ Trigger dynamic network or compute scaling based on device/service telemetry.
- **API-Driven Integration** â€“ IoT platform and network orchestrator communicate via TM Forum-compliant APIs.
